**SUMMARY ![ref1]**

I am a computer science engineer currently working as a Graduate Engineer- Digital (AI/ML) with Mott MacDonald India. I am open to new opportunities in the ML/DL domain. I have been passionately pursuing this domain since my B. Tech final year project and have been working on such projects as a professional for the last two years. I have completed a ML/DL certification program from IIT Delhi and have a B. Tech in Computer Science and Engineering form Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal (July 2021). ![](Aspose.Words.597f0ce3-2a31-4802-b1f5-72ba70e61089.004.png)

**EXPERIENCE ![ref1]**

**Graduate Engineer- Digital (AI/ML)**, 10/2021 - Current  

**Mott MacDonald India -** Noida**  

Health & Safety Detection Model (May 2023)

Customization and modification of an AI detection model for detection of safety helmets and vest on workers on site. An existing YOLO based model was customized to suit the required detection parameters. These changes were implemented using python. Modifications were made to increase the detection precision to a desired minimum of 95%. 

Ash Dieback Detection Project (September 2022)

The goal of this project was to identify Ash trees infected by Dieback disease (for Prediction Model). A Pascal VOC based graded detection model was being considered to scale the degree of damage caused by the disease to identify the ones which could fall on highways leading to accidents/damage to infra.

Bird Call Detection (June 2022) 

An attempt to develop a model to identify birds from their calls. It involved data scrapping to procure data from an online open-source database to be stored in CSV format.

Pavement Health Check Model (April 2022)

To develop a Visual Assessment model for detection of pavement defects by 3D Annotation of planned videos to distinguish different pavement defects and segmenting them using CVAT 

Bridge Defects Detection Project (December 2021)

Detection of various types of defects in existing bridges by annotation of defects using Django Labeler in Anaconda environment 

Presto Project (December 2021)

Creation of API to extract and process live streaming data from the National UK Rail server. Involved extraction and interpretation of live streaming XML data through Python requests and processing it into a user-friendly tabular format.

project was to extract the number plate text. I have used EasyOCR to  successfully extract the number plate text. Also, a strategy was 

incorporated in the program to reduce the number of frames to be 

processed. This has significantly increased the efficiency of the detector 

system. In this project as we are just detecting the number plates, 

processing just one frame per second suffices to capture all the vehicles 

rather than processing all the 30 frames per second as in the original 

video. This process not only reduces the file sizes of the output video, but 

also reduces the folder size of the XML detections thus reducing 

computational efforts significantly and increases detection speed. This 

entire project has been executed on Google Colab. ![](Aspose.Words.597f0ce3-2a31-4802-b1f5-72ba70e61089.015.png)
